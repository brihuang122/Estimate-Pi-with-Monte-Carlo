hw_2_task1 is the first task of the project. It takes an input, k, and calculates N-total, the total number of dots, with the equation 2^k. Using the total number of dots, a for-loop returns an estimate of pi as the output. From this, an error is also calulated by subtracting pi from the estimate and finding the absolute value. Using these values, a plot was created with the xasis representing the N-total and two yaxis representing the pi estimate and error. hw_2_task is the second task of the project. It uses a while-loop to find the value of the pi estimate. Unlike the first task, it uses tol=2^-k as an input and returns the estimate of pi an the output. tic-toc is also used to record the elapsed time and is graphed in relation to the different tol. hw_2_task is the last task of the project. It is similar to task one but has a different for-loop. using VideoWriter, it displays 1000 points being generated and plotted on the graph. Dots outside the circle are marked in different colors from the dots inside the circle.
